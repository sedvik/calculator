This is an implementation of The Odin Project Calculator project. The calculator supports click and keyboard input, with the following keyboard keybinds:

"<-": backspace key

"=": Enter key

"Clear": Delete key

0 - 9: Corresponding homerow or number pad keys

".": corresponding homerow or numberpad key

"/", "*", "-", "+" - Corresponding homerow or number pad keys

The following were primarily practiced as part of this project:

- DOM manipulation/event listeners
- CSS grid
- Calculator logic implementation
